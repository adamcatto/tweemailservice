* delete tweets.csv after sending mail
* handle cases where a user has not tweeted over time period in question
* actually download + display media in email instead of media URLs
* setup.py:
    + email account
    + email password
    + twitter dev auth keys/tokens
    + let user control time over which to schedule emails
    + setup plist to run main.py in background on macOS / same sort of thing for other operating systems
    + set config.last_update_timestamp to datetime.now()
    + initialize users to follow
        + twitter username
        + lists
        + comma-separated CLI args (or flexible patterns)
* write scripts to allow user to update config params without having to go into the config, e.g.
    + --add_account_to_follow
    + --add_list_to_follow
    + --remove_account_to_follow
    + --remove_list_to_follow
    + --overwrite_config_param (param_name, new_value)
* make sure the retweet/reply filtering actually works
* possibly get tweets that tweet is replying to
* fix key/value switching in tweet dict to be emailed
* format everything more nicely
